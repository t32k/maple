# Set this to the root of your project when deployed:
http_path = ".."
css_dir = "../files/css"
sass_dir = "../files/css/sass"
images_dir = ".."
javascripts_dir = "../files/js"
#sprite_load_path = "/files/img/sprites/tabs"

# You can select your preferred output style here (can be overridden via the command line):
# output_style = :expanded or :nested or :compact or :compressed
output_style = :expanded

# To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions. Uncomment:
# relative_assets = false

# To disable debugging comments that display the original location of your selectors. Uncomment:
line_comments = false


# If you prefer the indented syntax, you might want to regenerate this
# project again passing --syntax sass, or you can uncomment this:
# preferred_syntax = :sass
# and then run:
# sass-convert -R --from scss --to sass sass scss && rm -rf sass && mv scss sass

# Increment the deploy_version before every release to force cache busting.
